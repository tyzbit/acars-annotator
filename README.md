# acars-annotator

A simple daemon that listens to ACARS messages, hydrates them with additional
data via external lookups and then submits the message to a specified receiver
such as a webhook.

Enable annotators and receivers by filling in the required environment
variables for them.

## Available annotators

- ACARS: This will add key/value fields for all data in the original ACARS
  message
- ADS-B Exchange (Only SingleAircraftPositionByRegistration at the moment)

## Available receivers

- New Relic
- Discord
- Custom Webhook - See below for usage

#### Webhooks

In order to define the payload for your webhook, edit `receiver_webhook.tpl`
and add the fields and values that you need with
[valid Go template syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).
An example is provided which shows a very simple webhook payload
that uses annotations from the ACARS annotator.

#### Example .env

```
ACARSHUB_HOST=192.168.0.100
ACARSHUB_PORT=15550
ACARSHUB_VDLM2_PORT=15555
ANNOTATE_ACARS=true
ANNOTATE_VDLM2=true
LOGLEVEL=debug
WEBHOOK_URL=http://webhook
WEBHOOK_METHOD=POST
ACARS_ANNOTATOR_SELECTED_FIELDS=acarsAircraftTailCode,acarsExtraURL,acarsFlightNumber,acarsFrequencyMHz,acarsMessageText
VDLM_ANNOTATOR_SELECTED_FIELDS=acarsAircraftTailCode,acarsExtraURL,acarsFlightNumber,vdlm2FrequencyHz,acarsMessageText
```
